## Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Your Airtable Account
1. Go to [airtable.com](https://airtable.com/signup)
2. Sign up for free (no credit card needed)

### Step 2: Create Your Waitlist Base
1. Click **"Start from scratch"**
2. Name it **"Hero Fitness Waitlist"**
3. Rename the default table from "Table 1" to **"Waitlist"** (exact spelling matters!)

### Step 3: Set Up Your Fields
Delete all default fields and create these exact fields:

| Field Name | Field Type | Notes |
|------------|------------|-------|
| **Phone** | Single line text | Primary field |
| **Platform** | Single select | Options: iOS, Android |
| **Timestamp** | Date & time | Include time, use GMT |
| **Shared** | Checkbox | Default unchecked |
| **Shared At** | Date & time | When user shared (optional) |

### Step 4: Get Your API Credentials

#### Get Your API Key:
1. Go to [airtable.com/create/tokens](https://airtable.com/create/tokens)
2. Click **"Create new token"**
3. Name it: "Hero Fitness Waitlist"
4. Add these scopes:
   - `data.records:read`
   - `data.records:write`
5. Add your base: Select "Hero Fitness Waitlist"
6. Click **"Create token"**
7. **Copy the token** (you won't see it again!)

#### Get Your Base ID:
1. Go to [airtable.com/api](https://airtable.com/api)
2. Click on your "Hero Fitness Waitlist" base
3. Look for the Base ID in the introduction (starts with `app`)
4. It looks like: `appXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`

### Step 5: Add to Environment Variables

Create or update your `.env.local`:
```bash
AIRTABLE_API_KEY=patXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=appXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

### Step 6: Add to Vercel
```bash
# Using CLI (recommended)
vercel env add AIRTABLE_API_KEY
# Paste your API key

vercel env add AIRTABLE_BASE_ID  
# Paste your Base ID
```

Or add manually in Vercel Dashboard â†’ Settings â†’ Environment Variables

## Testing Your Setup

1. Restart your dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Click a download button on your site
3. Submit a phone number
4. Check your Airtable base - you should see the entry!

## View Your Data

- **Airtable Dashboard**: [airtable.com](https://airtable.com) - Visual spreadsheet view
- **Export**: Click the "..." menu â†’ Download CSV
- **Share**: Invite team members to view/edit

## Troubleshooting

### "Waitlist service not configured"
- Make sure both `AIRTABLE_API_KEY` and `AIRTABLE_BASE_ID` are in `.env.local`
- Restart your dev server after adding environment variables

### "Table 'Waitlist' not found"
- Your table must be named exactly "Waitlist" (case-sensitive)
- Check spelling in your Airtable base

### "Field 'Phone' cannot accept value"
- Make sure your field names match exactly (Phone, Platform, Timestamp, Shared, Shared At)
- Field types must match (Single line text for phone, Single select for platform, etc.)

## Why Airtable?

## Tracking Shares

The app automatically tracks when users share the waitlist:
- When a user clicks "Share & Jump to Front", the `Shared` checkbox is marked
- The `Shared At` field records when they shared
- You can create filtered views to see:
  - Users who shared vs didn't share
  - Share rate by platform (iOS vs Android)
  - Time between joining and sharing

### Creating a "Shared Users" View:
1. In Airtable, click **"Create"** â†’ **"Grid view"**
2. Name it "Shared Users"
3. Add a filter: `Shared` = âœ“
4. Sort by `Shared At` (newest first)

## Next Steps

1. Set up email notifications (Airtable Automations)
2. Create views (iOS only, Android only, Shared, etc.)
3. Add more fields (email, referral source, etc.)
4. Set up automations for users who share (special rewards, priority access)

Your waitlist is now powered by Airtable with share tracking! ðŸŽ‰
